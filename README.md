# Sorting_Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of basic sorting algorithms in Python v3.5.2

Algorithms implemented are:
- Bubble Sort:
  - Worst-case time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Best-case time complexity:	O(n)
  - Average time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Worst-case space complexity: O(1)
  
- Insertion Sort:
  - Worst-case time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Best-case time complexity:	O(n)
  - Average time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Worst-case space complexity: O(1)

- Merge Sort:
  - Worst-case time complexity:	O(n log(n))
  - Best-case time complexity:	O(n log(n))
  - Average time complexity:	O(n log(n))
  - Worst-case space complexity: O(n)
  
- Quick Sort:
  - Worst-case time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Best-case time complexity:	O(n log(n))
  - Average time complexity:	O(n log(n))
  - Worst-case space complexity: O(log(n))
  
- Selection Sort:
  - Worst-case time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Best-case time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Average time complexity:	O(n^2)
  - Worst-case space complexity: O(1)
